# Zoom Joiner Bot
Are you tired of waking up to go to zoom class in the age of covid? Use this application so your computer goes to class for you. It features the pyautogui module which is able to mimic your mouse and click around. See documentation in code and the directions below for use.

# Some important logistical details
This program was written on a Windows machine, which means some of the initalizing protocols/opening functions may or may not be correct for users on other interfaces such as mac or linux. Be sure to modify the applications folder or cd into the correct directory before using this app. In addition, pyautogui has some strange syntactical choices, such as strings being the only compatible interface for the typwrite method, so be sure to present it in that form. Everything else is included in the comments in the documentation and the comments should be heavily referred to in any sort of debugging/reframing practices.

# How to use this program
All the code is prewritten. All you have to do is modify the current_time value at the bottom. See the documentation in the comments of the code for more information. Once modified, cd into the correct directory and run in terminal with the following command:
-python3 joiner.py

The autogui should open zoom and fill in the corresponding information at the modified time.
