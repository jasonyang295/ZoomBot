# Zoom Joiner Bot
Are you tired of waking up to go to zoom class in the age of covid? Use this application so your computer goes to class for you. It features the pyautogui module which is able to mimic your mouse and click around. See documentation in code and the directions below for use.


# How to use this program
All the code is prewritten. All you have to do is modify the current_time value at the bottom. See the documentation in the comments of the code for more information. Once modified, cd into the correct directory and run in terminal with the following command:
-python3 joiner.py

The autogui should open zoom and fill in the corresponding information at the modified time.
